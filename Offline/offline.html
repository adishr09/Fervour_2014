                            The team that finishes with the round in given time limit and correctly, qualifies for the next round.

                            10 teams will qualify for this round. The qualifying team gets a code to be run on compiler, already fed into the                                     computer. This code will contain syntactical and logical bugs that need to be corrected in a time limit of 20 minutes.

                            6 teams qualify for this round, once they debug the code in previous round in minimum time. In this round, a question will                             be provided that has to be coded on the compiler in minimum time.

                                with his presence of mind to overcome obstacles and use nearby resources to finish the obstacle course.

                         An event which combines mind with heart.. err sorry, fun!<br>
If you're looking for an event that tests your skills to decode information, solve riddles and do that pretty quickly, then look no further. 'I'm feeling lucky', presented by BVPIEEE as part of 'Fervour 2014: Live your Reality in the Virtual World', aims to do just that. And you have an aid: Google!<br>

The event is divided into two rounds:<br>
                        <b>  R1:</b> Titled 'Do you even Google?', the first round is a rapid fire round that checks your spontaneity. The participants have to text their answers to a given number and the quickest correct answers get the highest points. <br>
<b>R2:</b> In the second round, titled 'Digital Fortress', you gotta rack your brains to unlock clues and breach that Digital Fortress! The questions will be fun (and twisted!) and participants can take help from the internet. Strategy, right direction of thinking, correct analysis and spontaneity will make all the difference. 
<br>
So, let's brainstorm right away!
