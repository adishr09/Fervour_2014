									<h3>I'm Feeling lucky</h3>
									<p>An event which combines mind with heart.. err sorry, fun!<br />
Looking for an event that tests your skills to decode information, solve riddles and do that pretty quickly, ???. 'I'm Feeling Lucky!', presented by BVPIEEE as part of 'Fervour 2015: Comic Con', aims to do just that. And you have an aid: Google!
                                        <br /><br />
The event is divided into two rounds:
                                        <br /><br />
R1: Titled 'Do you even Google?', the first round is a rapid fire round that checks your spontaneity. The participants have to text their answers to a given number and the quickest correct answers get the highest points.
                                        <br />
R2: In the second round, titled 'Riddle me this?', you gotta rack your brains to unlock clues and solve those riddles! The questions will be fun (and twisted!) and participants can take help from the internet. Strategy, right direction of thinking, correct analysis and spontaneity will make all the difference.
                                        <br />
So, let's brainstorm right away!

									<h3> Valar Moghulis</h3>
									<p>
                                        Try to think back to the days when you first started playing chess. You'll likely remember games where you virtually gave your pieces away to your opponent; before you knew it, your opponent had all your pieces, and your poor king was left all alone (and was likely soon checkmated).
                                        <br /><br />
                                        In losing chess, this nightmare situation is actually the goal of the game! The object is to lose all of your pieces, leaving yourself with nothing left on the board. It's easy to understand why this game is often called "antichess," as all of the normal rules of strategy and tactics are turned on their head.
                                        <br /><br />
