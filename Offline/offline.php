						<p class="dummy-text">"Money was never a big motivation for me : except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing                            the game." - Donald J. Trump</p>
						<p class="dummy-text">We've all been bowled over by 'The Wolf of Wall Street'...Calling out to all you Jordan Belforts...to                               participate in "BULLS N BEARS" a virtual Stock Marketing event . This event creates a chance for you to enter a mock share                          market and lets one trade and gain market experience without having to invest actual money. So If you have never known what a                       share is, and have only wondered how everybody buys shares and makes riches, here is just the game to help you get started. If                          the beguiling world of stocks fascinates you, if you have the nerve to compete with the ferocious wolves of Wall Street,                             then this is the place to be. So trade your stocks right away and be a billionaire though virtually.!</p>
