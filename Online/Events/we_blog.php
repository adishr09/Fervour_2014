			<p>WeBlog: Think, Blog, Repeat
			We are delighted to announce 'WeBlog: Think, Blog, Repeat' as part of Online Fervour for all those bloggers out there! We know there's a wealth of writing talent around and what better chance to showcase it than through a blogging competition? We'll be announcing a few topics and all you gotta do is select the one that appeals to you the most and start blogging! Your writing can be serious or comic, emotional or analytical, or a combination of all those things - it's entirely up to you. Conversational, chatty styles are lovely for blogs and we would love it if you could incorporate these two. Just try to avoid cliches, jargon, generalizations and acronyms. 
			Keep it intriguing and different. 
			Get, set, type!
