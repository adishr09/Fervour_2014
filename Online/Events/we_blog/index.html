								<h2><b>Musings of a Metro traveller</b>: I fall in love everyday in the metro.</h2>
								<center><h3>Ayushi Singhal</h3><center><br><Br>
								<p>Not long ago, Delhites used to curse the public transport system of the national capital. Errant, reckless and rash bus drivers, showing no sign of courtesy even to the ladies as well as the elderly.</p>

								<p>It was difficult to tell whether the bus would stop at the allotted sight, whether it would reach the destination on time and whether it would stop on arrival or simply skip the waiting passengers. Usual fear of occasional breakdowns, long traffic jams, the overall condition of the buses with torn, swinging seats, over-crowding inside and the shrill music because of the rattling sound, inside had the people pray for an alternative.</p>

								<p>But with the arrival of METRO, traveling from one place to the other in Delhi has become joyfully exciting fast, noiseless, dust free and absolutely dependable. There is no fear to miss appointment, or have your clothes dirty. You travel in the comfort of A.C. coaches, while the information about the stops is continuously communicated on inter-com. When traveling, you enjoy the outside view to your heart’s content.</p>

								<p>A place where people, all people without distinction, the poor and the rich, the doctor and the sick, the employee and the laborer, the commuter and the tourist, meet and walk by each other several times a day, sometimes talk to each other, sometimes say hello, sometimes recognize each other, other times ignore each other, like each other or disgust each other, fall in love with each other or break away from each other. Here, life flows under artificial light, it flows fast. Because they all have somewhere to go to, a final destination ….and, curiously, are always running late.</p>

								<p>For most people, living in Delhi, METRO is their great pride, as it has improved their health by making traveling stress free. The popularity of this great blessing can be judged by the fact that it provides commutation to more than half a million passengers daily. On festive occasions, their number increases manifold. Metro’s completion and its joyous acceptance by the people makes one feel proud of being an Indian. It shows that we are capable of achieving great feats, indeed! </p>

								<h2><b>Musings of a Metro traveller</b></h2>
								<center><h3>Dhwani Mohan, MSIT</h3><center><br><Br>
								<p>There he was, leaning against the wall. He had offered his seat to a lady (not sure if she could be referred to as one, considering the condescendingly intimidating expressions on her face and the horrifying aura that she was carrying around her), like a true gentleman would. A pair of headphones, resting on his messy hair, kissing the outlines of his ears. A pair of Ray-Ban shades, shining victoriously, sitting at the top his pear shaped nose, a hint of blue eyes peeking in through those translucent brown lenses. And from what I could decipher, his perfectly shaped lips were mumbling something familiar, something I had had an encounter with, something I knew.. I looked at those again. They were moving perfectly, not that there was a code of conduct conventionally set, that had to be followed. I followed the movements of his mouth, trying my best to focus on deciphering whatever it was that they were trying to say to..me, but in vain. My eyes traced the curve of his neck, going all the way down to his broad shoulders. His loose T-shirt was not really accentuating his physique but one could get a glimpse of it from the protruding muscles from his arms, that subtly showed through the sleeves. My eyes followed back to tracing the features of his very beautiful face, his indented cheeks, his square jaw, and those eys, oh, those eyes! “Take those shades off”, I murmured under my breath. And it was almost as if God had blessed me with a midas tongue that he gradually slipped out his hand out of the pocket of the rotten pair of jeans that he was wearing and his thoughts concurred with mine. He unveiled his eyes with his hands and I couldn’t help but gaze at those with an expression on my face that I did not particularly want to show. I caught myself smiling like an idiot, for ‘apparently’ no reason at all. Those eyes, oh, those blue eyes! They moved around to scan the compartment, as if, to look for someone desperately. My heart was pounding. I fixed my hair and reset my position, like a kid would on seeing his teacher who’s supposed to grade him for the day. I felt..stupid, but delusionally happy. This was it. His eyes were following and would soon set their gaze on my face. I breathed, deep in, preparing myself for the moment. And boom! Our eyes met. His thick lashes disrupting the lock that his eyes had with mine, as he blinked. I was unconsciously trying not to do the same. I wanted to have the most of this moment, I didn’t want to miss a single blink of his eye, a single wrinkle on his forehead, a single freckle on his face. He might not be the most beautiful face I had ever seen, but he was sort of..perfect. My eyes locked on his, and it wasn’t until a second or two that I realized that there was a curve forming on his face and I could feeling my heart pounding right out of my chest. It was like a celebration inside my stomach, a party..like a thousand butterflies dancing inside and a single glimpse of this carnival showed on my face with a reciprocating curve. I wanted this. So badly. I wanted to go up to him and tell him how I had fallen for his eyes, his smile and his hair, but fate had planned otherwise. The bliss of two seconds was crushed by a voice saying, “Next station is Rajiv Chowk”. He turned his face in a thousand directions, gathering himself. I wasn’t sure until I saw him picking up his bag from the floor. I was..befuddled. I did not know what to say or do. I could’ve run a thousand miles to stay in this very moment, but reality kicked in. There was a knot in my stomach. I felt a sting. I desperately wanted him to stay. The pain was ascending now. I looked at him turn his back to me, waiting for the doors to open. I waited for one last glance and again, God was probably listening to all of my desires, but fulfilling only some, like a sadistic benefactor. He turned his head back to me and I saw the familiar curve on his face. It hit me like a thousand trucks. The pain was excruciating. I was resisting the pain with all my heart and gut and I succeeded. I think..because it wasn’t the pain that I was feeling now..I felt nothing..as I watched the doors open and witnessed his exit..from my life. I’d never see him..I went numb. </p>
								
								<p id = "#2">I was looking around like a zombie, seeing things, not thinking. And it wasn’t until the closing of the doors was disrupted by a figure that I grew out of my suicidal thoughts. I looked at the figure fighting his way through the doors and victoriously finding his way in. He was panting. I could see his face cringing..but it was sort of..beautiful. He kept his bag on the floor and started to gather himself. I felt the blood rushing through my veins again as I watched him settle in. There he was now, leaning against the walls..</p>

								<h2><b>10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT ME</b></h2>
								<center><h3>Rahul Krishnan</h3><center><br><Br>
								<p>Given a chance and anonymity, of course, which obviously makes it much easier, we can list a thousand things that we hate about every other person we know. And if you are a student, you must be very eager and anxious to let someone know what you hate about them (considering the age and general daily life of a student).Letting a person know that you hate something about them seems easy, But are we ready to accept our own short comings? Can we digest the scenario of a person coming up to us and saying that they hate some particular thing about us? Perhaps not!</p>

								<p>Our egos don’t allow us to take that from another person. So what if….the other person is ME? Seems fair then. Certainly no ego issues in this case.I’ll attempt to think of, and list, 10 things that I hate about myself. You are free to read ‘I’ as ‘we’ if you think you hate that particular thing about yourself too. Knowing that you are not the only one might ease the acceptance process.</p>

								<ol>
								<br><br><li> <b>I think I am funny</b></li><br><br>

								<p>Why do I hate that? Read it again….i ‘think’ I am funny. Don’t you just hate it when you crack a fantastic bone tickler but everyone around has one of these three reactions</p>

								<ul>
								<br><li>”You sure help me with files and stuff so I’ll laugh” look.(100% chance that the fake laughter burns your insides)</li>
								<br><li>”oh god…you poor thing” stare.(you start questioning your existence in the universe at this point)</li>
								<br><li>Someone saying”ayeeee hayeeeee” or “p.j” just after you finish (and you stand there confused as hell…..because people laugh to that, and not your joke).</li>
								</ul>
								<br><p>So sometimes I keep on bombarding the masses with my evergreen classics, without knowing what kind of pain they have to endure. To all you poor ‘funny’ people, let’s stand united and have it scribbled in our brave hearts that not all arrows from a quiver reach the bull’s eye. Yet, the quiver is not to be blamed.</p>
								
								<br><br><li><b>I care a lot</b></li><br><br>

								<p>Before you go ‘awwwwwww’. Let me tell you one thing you must never forget (Read that in one of these four voices: Gandalf the white, Dumbaldore, the Dark Vader, or Morgan Freeman). Caring a lot about everything that is around you might get you a “you are so nice J “text from the girl you like every leap year. But that is never going to get you a minute of peace. I am not advocating that being a selfish and mean person is right.NO! ONE MUST NOT BE SELFISH!</p>

								<p>But take a moment and think….What do you do if you care about anything, You ‘worry’…so basically, caring has you worried all the time and while you think that you would be appreciated for being a caring modern day saint,you are wrong ,rather you are thought of as a buzz kill or fun killer. So if you have a good heart, reserve it for worthy people. Chances are, they might fail to appreciate it. But a good heart is always filled with hope…don’t lose it. And all you other heartless monsters. You can stop laughing at this one now! (if you wish to J ßsee that…that’s me being caring and nice)</p>

								<br><br><li><b>I am a big foodie</b></li><br><br>

								<p>If you have your hands raised for a high five and at the same time, are wondering if that is something to hate, let me tell you this, first of all, hi5. Secondly, it is a thing to hate if you hang around with people who just eat to survive. Mostly because otherwise you’d have to hate all your good friends so it’s just easy to hate your own appetite.Every once in while I have to suffer torments like being called a bhukkad, or someone casually squeezing a “kitna khaega” in the lunch time conversations. It’s funny that people don’t actually hate it if you are foodie; they just act in a way that makes you hate it yourself.</p>

								<p>So if you eat 2 quantities more of anything than others, it’s just better to eat it alone or with a food buddy. A food buddy would never let you feel bad about your kumbhkaran appetite and would gladly give you a competition. If you have a food buddy already, I bet you are thinking about him/her right now….say a silent thanks to them! If you are not a foodie….it’s just bad that you don’t treat foodies right….’shame shame puppy shame’!!!!</p>

								<br><br><li><b>I am always up for a competition</b></li><br><br>

								<p>I am one of those people who have this extreme case of obsessive compulsive thing with winning every argument, every trivia and every other stupid thing that has you competing in any way with anything. I might just punch my own shadow to establish that I am tougher (remember point 1? Yeah this is it!)</p>

								<p>From video games to chidia udd,I get extremely cranky if I lose at something. It doesn’t even have to be at something I am good at.Do you think you have the same problem??….well my problem is more severe…so I win! You lose!</p>

								<p>na nana na na nana nana naa naaa!!!</p>

								<br><br><li><b>I am very honest</b></li><br><br>

								<p>You might have figured out how this is something I hate. So I’ll not explain.</p>

								<p>When I was young, my teacher would appreciate my honesty and….wait!....i am just making that up. Truth is, my honesty was never rewarded. I laugh at all those moral science books I was made to read which had ‘honesty is the best policy’ written on it which, now I think were pamphlets of propaganda to make children stupid or something.</p>

								<p>I mean, think of this scenario…..Johny Johny….yes papa….eating sugar? Yes papa (Johny gets beaten crazy because Johny wasn’t supposed to eat sugar (Indian household)), Atleast Johny was able to stall the beating for a couple of more rhymes by lying. Don’t be a liar. Just if you can learn some white lies….it would be great. I often have friends ask me what I hate about them or something like that…while they expect a cheesy “nothing at all”, My honest, yet stupid brain thinks of a thousand things and my mouth which is eternally enslaved to my brain, does its duty and blabber all that I can think of,in one breath! This obviously leaves the other person enraged and with a sudden thirst for my blood.</p>

								<p>And for dummies who could not figure out why I hate being honest…honesty always lands you in trouble…confession is always the last thing one must do(unless it’s anything related to love or something in that case..bol daal! ). By the way Write all this down if you want to live through kalyug!</p>

								<li><b>I don’t take risks</b></li><br><br>

								<p>Okay serious stuff here. i hate this because, taking a risk puts you on edge, If you don’t, you blend in with the background….but you never stand out!</p>

								<p>I believe a winner is who does something unique. And to do something unique… you need to take a risk. Playing it safe always has you in a no lose no profit situation. That is fine until your ambitions take over your ways of life.</p>

								<p>Imagine the thrill of gambling with everything and anything you do.(no I don’t mean the way Pandavas did….if you are actually thinking of cards, casinos and Las Vegas….you need a to read a book or two about poetic writing skills!). What I mean is, being ready to go the extra mile to stand out than the rest of the crowd! If you believe you have this tendency of playing life safely….you might want to rethink your approach towards everything or else you might feel stuck or caged forever.</p>

								<br><br><li><b>I am very self-obsessed</b></li><br><br>

								<p>Okay now this is something that every teenager can connect with. I love myself to an extent that I believe cupid’s golden arrow stuck my sorry bum when I was in front of a mirror. I don’t ACTUALLY hate this about me, but I sure want to minimize the extent to which I am self-obsessed.</p>

								<p>That is mainly because, i have often observed that people around me get really irritated (I like to believe that they are jealous…but that’s a secret! Shhhhh!!!) when they see my love for myself. Be it the selfies I take or the humongous hours I spend ogling myself at the mirror, one would be very right to give me a narcissist tag. Now if you don’t know the difference between being self-obsessed and being a narcissist, then read on. Do you have your own picture as your phone’s background? Does your phone gallery contain more selfies than any other photo? If yes? Then my friend, thou art a narcissist!</p>

								<p>Now the problem is, in the whole process of loving yourself, you sometimes forget to appreciate the loving actions that others might direct towards you. So if you can change that about you, that would be nice. And as of me, I don’t plan to change that about me any time soon. Perhaps I love the love that I lovingly give myself.</p>

								<br><br><li><b>I get bored very easily</b></li><br><br>

								<p>This! I just hate this about me, and yet I can’t devise any way to improve this about me.</p>

								<p>The main reason for this problem is my hyper fluctuating attention span. Get this, I get ‘bored’ with something because I develop an ‘interest’ in something very quickly! It’s funny if you think that. This trait of mine has proven to be extremely annoying to the people around me. Many of them have thought of me being uninterested is because there words/actions are boring. Well, to my very interesting friends, I act like that, not because I don’t find you interesting or anything, it’s just that I find some other thing(s) more interesting that your words/actions….and perhaps you!</p>

								<p>If you experience the same, you might also know the pain of having to endure a whole song with your friends, while in your head you’ve already played the whole playlist. You might have to sit through a whole movie while your brain starts recollecting all the movies you ever saw.</p>

								<p>It’s just sad when you outgrow the current trends. And then you are stuck until a new one is created. You can beat that by doing something unique. This is something I do personally. And by unique, I don’t mean doing something extremely crazy or anything. You just have to think of unique ways to occupy yourself, because the usual listening to music/sketching/cooking just won’t do any good!</p>

								<br><br><li><b>I sleep a lot</b></li><br><br>

								<p>This is something I love and hate at the same time. And surely this is something we all have in common! It is just so tempting. We all love to shut out our little windows to the world and catch a little peace in the form of sleep and transcend into a world of dreams. The whole thing seems so magical, you just can’t get enough of it. Be it a big 14 hour sleep on my lovely bed or the open eyed nap during a lecture, I love to sleep. I’d rather prefer a good sleep (everyday) than most of the leisures available to a mortal being.</p>

								<p>Now you might think why I hate it when I am clearly so in love with the whole concept of sleep. I do love the concept of sleep, the ‘concept’. But sleeping itself renders zero productivity! Think about all the time you waste sleeping which undoubtedly you can invest in something that might actually do you any good, yes I know the effects of sleep on health! But practically, too much sleeping is unhealthy altogether!</p>

								<p>Hours flushed down the drain. Hours which can actually be utilized in fulfilling of dreams than piling them up in your sleep!</p>

								<p>So I believe if I could just keep my nap hours to the minimum, I can actually have many hours of productive time which I can waste by doing something else than sleeping! Or perhaps use that in doing something productive.</p>

								<br><br><li><b>I have a short fuse</b></li><br><br>

								<p>Raise your hand if you have a temper issue. If you rose a clinched fist, you have a temper issue, otherwise I don’t think you problem is severe enough.</p>

								<p>My fuse, in my own opinion, is very close to 1.2365 millimeter. It doesn’t take the tiniest of a trigger to make me all green and big like the hulk! But that doesn’t mean I start smashing things and start swinging people into air. I just get really mad and perhaps start shouting. But the real damage occurs when I start thinking. Ever felt the need to twist the sweet life out of a person? But still stand there without even a tiny eye lid movement? If yes, then you sure understand the heart burn. It all happens inside your head, you can’t act out but you just want to become a human tornado.</p>

								<p>And the funniest thing is, ‘you’ don’t even have to take an offense. Sometimes you can’t see how someone else has a bad situation and get mad at that! Sometimes the things that set you off might not even extract a frown if it were someone else in your place or others would not even care to notice. Some reasons would actually qualify for absurd and crazy for normal people. For example: I actually get mad at random birds when they decide to show there mugs through my window (hi5 if you hate pigeons and there mannerisms) Or sometimes I just wish my keyboard was a guy so I can punch the juice out of him whenever a key is jammed. If you have the same problem, try back counting loudly or drinking a lot of water. Back counting loudly when you are angry would make people around you laugh and that might lighten the mood. And drinking a lot of water might put you at risk of spilling it on your clothes while shouting with a mouthful of water.(try it the next time!)</p>

								<p id = "#3">So these are 10 things that I think I hate about me, and these are 10 things that make me unique. That’s right, whatever you hate about yourself is also what makes you different. We tend to love our similarities with others and often forget to cherish our differences. When I really think about it, I wouldn’t want to change all that I hate about myself. Perhaps I should try and change them in a way that they don’t affect the people around me. So if come across anything that you hate about yourself, know this, it is a unique trait that you have, and you should be proud of it, just take care that it doesn’t make someone else sad or anything, rest you don’t have to change a single freckle about yourself!!</p>

								<h2><b>Musings of a Metro traveller</b></h2>
								<center><h3>Abhinav Singh</h3><center><br><Br>
								<p><b>The Girl In The Red Hoodie.</b></p>
								<p>I walked at a normal pace as the others dashed past me, I looked at my watch. The train had almost arrived, and I ran too, leaving the others behind, the girl in the hoodie had almost arrived.</p>
								
								<p>I seemed to love pain. It was something I deliberately let hang around even after the party was over. I know I couldn’t handle it too much but I couldn’t let go of the things it made me feel, of the things it made me think about. I had no severe life threatening problems, I was just caught off guard every single time they ricocheted past me. And I always wondered why. Things were fine, mostly smooth and yet I felt that thing missing, like something had stopped, something which was meant to, supposed to happen throughout my entire my life and in a sudden flash, it was all gone. I don’t know when the “flash” flashed, I don’t remember.</p>
								
								<p>I checked past security, ignoring the judgmental, speculative eyes of the guard as he ran his hands all over my excessively damped clothes. I raced through the stairs, the automatic ones were too slow. The yellow lights flashed at a distance, as the train approached, my heart beating faster with every blink, the size of the train was increasing. I said I didn’t blink much, but it was always the train which made me. And it was all accidental.</p>
								
								<p>I would take the train back home from my office, every evening around this time, along with people I didn’t know, hadn’t seen, hadn’t met, and yet there was this familiarity which existed throughout the 4 coaches. They all had problems, and I just had those 40 minutes to take a breath and realize that fact.  </p>
								
								<p>A saw her a week back, for the first time in my life, but something told me that my eyes had had this experience before. Maybe it’s another form, my heart would reply. Maybe you are just too depressed for no reason at all, my head would conclude. She was fairly tall. That’s all I could say about her the first day I saw her. She would always wear that hoodie, covering most of her face, though her hair would manage to escape, sliding through the back of her ears. She had long shiny hair, and for 2 days straight, I couldn’t manage a single proper glimpse of her face.</p>
								
								<p>Travelling in the train isn’t always a task of linear transmission. You never just stand, sit, wait and leave..you see things. Peculiar little things floating about, giving you a glimpse of what short parts of their lives people reveal. All I wanted was to see her face, and so I stood, sat, waited, and painfully left, never managing a full view of her face. But something about her struck. She would always wear the same hoodie, and I was beginning to be obsessed about knowing what was underneath it. </p>
								
								<p>I would stand in the centre, she would always pick the corner. She would never sit, even though people offered her seats, she didn’t rest even when they were empty. I caught her eyes ones, they were black, a shade of black I hadn’t seen. Overreacting my brain would conclude, again, and yet that excitement of a fresh revelation remained.  </p>
								
								<p>It would be weird, I realized, to stare at someone like that, and even though I couldn’t help it, I knew she was aware of my unfazed gaze. She chose to ignore it. She too, would have her eyes transfixed, I don’t know at what, but I reckoned she knew what I was feeling, that hollow feeling of not being inspired. She is just minding her own business, like everyone else, my brain would conclude, much to my heart’s agony.</p>
								
								<p>But you should do something about it, my brain suggested. Ah, so you are intrigued too, my heart would mock. So I took my earphones out, plugged them in, and watched, yeah, that would make me seem less creepy I figured. I was never a “Metal” Person, I preferred Grunge. I rocked my head a little, enjoying this combination of music and her sight. 6 days passed like this.</p>
								
								<p>I wanted to talk to her, to see her, to know her and more than anything, to figure out this strange sense of attraction I had towards someone I couldn’t even properly see. That damn hoodie. I shifted my weight, still looking for a better view. She would get off 2 stops after mine. I had to track back home 3 because of her. The train would get almost vacant by then, only a few people hanging around. Some elderly people, a few school kid and her, in that damn hoodie. </p>
								
								<p>I sometimes feared that I had forgotten how to feel the things I used to, those songs didn’t make sense anymore, those places weren’t serene. All I had were memories, and memories alone. This though, was different. It wasn’t complicated. It was as simple as it could get. One stranger, wanting to know another stranger, in a train full of strangers.</p>
								
								<p>I stood, as always, as the crowd began to disappear. My heart sank as the doors opened and shut, I had to talk to her. Just 2 more stops left, my mind was racing with all those things I could say, all the things I could see. That was when she turned to her side, facing me, as I quickly averted my gaze, blood rushing to the back of my head. She unfolded her arms, and slowly walked towards me. I stood where I was, wanting to say something I know I couldn’t. It was her eyes, the first time I was seeing them. Some sense of pain lingered in those black shaded gates, there was also some twinkle. She was getting nearer, quickly now. I straightened myself, but as soon as I had, I noticed how her eyes weren’t matching mine, they were focused on something behind me. I lowered the sound of my music, but not completely, I knew I needed it. She paced right past me, evidently unaware of my presence and before I could turn or move, I heard the loudest cry I had in a long time. That was when I turned, and that was when I saw, the girl in the White hoodie, as she took a long sharp knife out of her sleeve and pierced the man’s neck, the man who was standing behind me. The man who was always there, sometimes with his friends, sometimes alone. how did she manage to get that knife in the metro was something I didn’t ponder over for a long time. Blood splattered all across, his expression slowly turned from surprise to fear to agony. I remember that, I remember that well. He went down on his knees, the blood falling faster than he was, there was a lot of it. She kept stabbing him in his chest as the elderly couple ran for it, to the far end of the coach. The two school kids watched with their mouths open, backing away slowly, their eyes opening for the first time in their lives. It all happened in a flash. That flash I forgot, that flash I missed, as I thought of a million things, watching her stab him to death. Run my brain said, stay said my heart. Watch said my eyes, redemption screamed my soul. The blood wasn’t red, it was purple, dark purple, as it raced with the train on the floor, rushing towards my feet. I knew I wasn’t breathing, the music was still on, I could hear both of them scream. With every stab, her big tears fell inside his ripped chest. With every stab, a pool of blood pounced all over her White hoodie. The train stopped, the door opened. She was still stabbing him, it was all slow motion, as the man waiting to enter the coach ran back to where he came from. The wind rushed in, as her stabs increased, and all this while I had not noticed her face. It was burned from the bottom of her neck to the side of her face. Her eyes were red now, not black. My music was dying now, “Alice In Chains” was now becoming “Slayer”. She is a psycho, she will kill you next, said my brain. No, this is hell, and the man’s blood has caused it said my heart. The doors remained opened, as she got up to her feet, the man dying motionless at her feet, his eyes popping out, there was blood all around, red splashed all over her hoodie. She dropped the knife as she got up slowly, still taking in short breaths, her eyes were now on me. I didn’t know what to feel. I was numb, I didn’t know what this meant, and yet from the inside, I think I knew. Tears raced down her magnificent face, sneaking from behind those drops of purple blood on her face.  I didn’t know what she was thinking, though her eyes reflected desperation, this didn’t make anything better, and yet this had to be done. I was not scared, for the first time in my life, I was not scared of something as real as her, looking right into my eyes. She was death, The Girl In The Red Hoodie. I wanted to hug her, to hold her tight, my feelings for her had changed, she was more familiar than before, she was now my responsibility. As I watched the uniforms running their way into the coach, I slowly walked towards her, my heart, head and soul, were all bleeding red. </p>
								
								<p id="4">It’s been two months now, since they dragged her to the station. Her sister was raped and killed by the same man she stabbed to death, that’s what the newspapers said. Her face was burned with acid by the same man who lay right there as I fought those uniforms, forcing them away. I watched the sun set, the hills weren’t majestic anymore, but the sun finally came into being. It was orange, as the light slowly faded away, the orange that reminded me of meaning, of resurrection. I was at the same metro station, at the same time, waiting for the same train, but somehow I would never board it ever again, my life had a different direction now.</p>

								<h2><b>ELECTIONS 2014: DANCE OF DEMOCRACY</b></h2>
								<center><h3>-Mansi Mittal, IGDTUW</h3><center><br><Br>
								<p>"Abki baar Modi Sarkaar", "Har Haath Shakti, Har Haath Tarakki", "Jhaadu chalao, Beimaan bhagao"</p>
								
								<p>I know we have been coming across all these slogans for quite some months now, so let's take a break. I won't compare any of the PM candidates here nor will I point out any mistakes of the ruling party. I don't even intend to write down anything about the candidate or party whom I voted for. A lot has already been and is being said on the aforesaid issues in the past few months. The media has covered the issue intensively, blogs have been flooded with varied articles on the matter and the impending power play of the largest democracy in the world has already been trending on the social networking sites. I would rather like to focus on a more broader and a more important aspect of the elections 2014 and that is the change in the people's perception towards their electoral right.</p>
								
								<p>Conducting general elections in a country with over 800 million voters is no less than fighting a war. Believe me there is no hyperbole in the statement. For us may be the elections are just about going to the polling station, waiting in a queue for sometime (you can easily skip this if you go at some odd hours of the day, say during the lunchtime), getting your name verified, getting a mark on a finger and then just finally pressing a button. Congo, your vote has been registered! But is it really that easy for the Election Commission or the officials on duty? Not at all. The EC has to do so many arrangements, from giving election symbols to all the registered parties and the individual candidates, chalking down the schedule for the polls, making all the necessary arrangements, recruiting and training a great manpower from various government organisations and educational institutions for conducting the elections and taking care of many more nick-knacks here and there. As far as the civilians who are entrusted with the election duty are considered, they do not find the work easy either. According to the current records, the number of these people is about 2,50,000 which is even more than the size of the military of UK.</p>
								
								<p>The general elections of 2014 are different altogether not only because of the largest ever election campaigns and a total of 1616 political parties registered with the Election Commission as of Feb, 2014, many with altogether different ideologies, but also due to the fact that 20% of the total electorate, i.e. around 14 crores of the total voters are going to exercise their voting right for the first time. Over 800 million people are going to vote in a span of 5 weeks. The polls this season are being contested by people from varied domains. Be it actors, social workers or even owners of big corporate houses, it seems everybody wants to taste power.</p>
								
								<p id="5">Now the onus is on the voters. It is the voters only who can choose the future of India, by choosing what is right for them and beneficiary for the society as well and possibly putting a check over dynastic politics as well. And given the statistics of the first four phases of the polls, people are coming out in large numbers to vote, largest ever in the last two decades. It may be due to the anti-incumbency factor or the urge of the people to bring out a change to the nation, one thing is for sure that democracy is winning. Whatever may be the results of the poll, whichever party may form the government and whoever may be our new Prime Minister, if the people have decided to take it onto themselves to decide the fate of the nation, then sooner or later the things will fall into place and we will witness the dance of democracy in real sense, where the voters will get entertained and not only those who are voted into power.</p>

								<h2><b>Musings Of A Metro Traveler: I fall in Love Everyday in the Metro.</b></h2>
								<center><h3>Charvi Jain</h3><center><br><Br>
								<p>I dream of trains every other night. I should modify that statement, actually.I dream of metro trains every other night. </p>
								
								<p>Sometimes I keep missing my train. Sometimes I wander around an unknown station. Walking down the stairs, climbing them up again, bumping into people, and no, I never pick their pockets, if that's what you're thinking.</p>

								<p>I've even had dreams where I'm competing with the Satan. We pick a random station and we predict if the next metro is going to be an eight coach metro or not. And there's a lot of betting involved, if you know what I mean. I still have no idea what the wager is, but that's besides the point, because he usually wins. Now, I am just saying, but I think the dude's been cheating. He's got supernatural powers and all I have is a milky bar in my back pocket! That's unfair, right?!</p>
								
								<p>You know what? It doesn't even matter anymore. Because, it's not about the Satan, it's about the metro trains. Satan might be a recurring character, but the entire story revolves around the metro trains and stations. It's like Lucas Scott might be a character in the show One Tree Hill, but the show is not about him, it's about a place, and the things and people that happened to that place.</p>
								
								<p>I take the metro almost everyday, and for 3 hours, five days a week, I find myself sitting in what appears to be a metallic box, with people that I might never bump into again. At this point, I have to say, that when there are metro trains involved, there's not much difference between dreams and reality. </p>
								
								<p>For all you know, the reality is much more beautiful.</p>
								
								<p>Except, this one time. You see, I was waiting for a train, while surreptitiously checking out the guy standing near by, who looked a wee bit like Andrew Garfield. I mean it is completely justified to do that, because hello? Andrew Garfield doppelganger? But, justifications aside, I should have been on the look out for fake Prada hand bags instead. Well, because, this happened:</p>
								
								<p><ol>
								<li>The minute the train arrived, I smiled to myself because I had just spotted an empty seat, and I was first in line. </li><br><br>
								<li>The doors open, and I casually walk in, hoping that Andrew Garfield is catching my oh-so-cool vibe, but then BAM!</li><br><br>
								<li>A fat (no offence meant, at least I stayed clear of the term "hippo like") Aunty swung her fake Prada bag like a ball and chain set stolen from an ancient British prison cell, and knocked me out with it.</li>
								</ol></p>
								
								<p>Needless to say, she got the seat, and Andrew Garfield found himself a pretty girl. And I was crouched down hunting for my glasses like Velma Dinkley from Scooby Doo! Not beautiful. Not even close. Also, Garfield can go spider web himself, Dinkley does not care anymore. No sir. Just kidding, Dinkley cares a little bit. </p>

								<p>The point I'm making is, that whether it is the malicious Aunty with a 10 kilos potato sack for a fake Prada, or the "Not Toby Real" Spiderman doppelganger, they're all more than people to me. They're all short stories that are a part of a much bigger story.</p>
								
								<p>More often than not, I find myself, sitting by myself on a crowded metro station, reminiscing about my DMRC misadventures. Sometimes, I end up laughing when I realize that more than a fair amount of Aunties have bullied me. On other times, I smile to myself when I look back on all the kids I've shared high fives with, and all the couples I've witnessed sharing secret smiles and whispers. </p>

								<p>But most of the time, I look around me and I search for more stories. The hassled woman with a dozen shopping bags and two absolute brats for kids, wondering why on earth did she decide to pick this life, silently asking God for a pause and rewind option.</p>

								<p>The Honey Singh wannabe, in a flashy neon colored shirt, who has most vulnerably given his heart away to the girl he's talking to over the phone, not withholding his laughter at every "adorable" thing she says, but trying ever so hard to hide his helplessness.</p>
								
								<p>And sometimes, while I'm busy transfiguring people into stories, I stumble upon the moment when for the first time in forever, I felt like a story. I time travel to the day when a girl walked over to a boy, cutting across the brutal Rajiv Chowk crowd, and felt a thousand amazonian butterflies break into a Can-Can routine in her stomach as she saw the boy's face melt into the widest, most innocent of all smiles. I follow her through the four hour long conversation that she shares with him, and I ride alongside her, as she takes a metro back home. And every single time, without fail, I feel an iron fist clench my heart, as I am hit with the realization, that all those moments when I've casually stepped into someone else' s life, uninvited, without has much as a polite knock, are finally working in a reverse karmic order. And try as I may, to cover up my heartbreak and my vulnerability, I've already been morphed into an open book, free for anyone to read.</p>
								
								<p id="6">As I sit, on a dusty platform, going over this insane series of events, I slowly fall in love. I fall in love with the beauty of the tragedy that all these stories, all these people have embraced with such affection. I fall in love with their incomplete nature, but most of all, I fall in love with the fact that complied together, they weave out the most magnificent novel that still remains unwritten. You see, I have always been an avid reader, so much so, that I don't need words anymore.  </p>
