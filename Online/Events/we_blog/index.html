								<h2><b>Musings of a Metro traveller</b>: I fall in love everyday in the metro.</h2>
								<center><h3>Ayushi Singhal</h3><center><br><Br>
								<p>Not long ago, Delhites used to curse the public transport system of the national capital. Errant, reckless and rash bus drivers, showing no sign of courtesy even to the ladies as well as the elderly.</p>

								<p>It was difficult to tell whether the bus would stop at the allotted sight, whether it would reach the destination on time and whether it would stop on arrival or simply skip the waiting passengers. Usual fear of occasional breakdowns, long traffic jams, the overall condition of the buses with torn, swinging seats, over-crowding inside and the shrill music because of the rattling sound, inside had the people pray for an alternative.</p>

								<p>But with the arrival of METRO, traveling from one place to the other in Delhi has become joyfully exciting fast, noiseless, dust free and absolutely dependable. There is no fear to miss appointment, or have your clothes dirty. You travel in the comfort of A.C. coaches, while the information about the stops is continuously communicated on inter-com. When traveling, you enjoy the outside view to your heart’s content.</p>

								<p>A place where people, all people without distinction, the poor and the rich, the doctor and the sick, the employee and the laborer, the commuter and the tourist, meet and walk by each other several times a day, sometimes talk to each other, sometimes say hello, sometimes recognize each other, other times ignore each other, like each other or disgust each other, fall in love with each other or break away from each other. Here, life flows under artificial light, it flows fast. Because they all have somewhere to go to, a final destination ….and, curiously, are always running late.</p>

								<p>For most people, living in Delhi, METRO is their great pride, as it has improved their health by making traveling stress free. The popularity of this great blessing can be judged by the fact that it provides commutation to more than half a million passengers daily. On festive occasions, their number increases manifold. Metro’s completion and its joyous acceptance by the people makes one feel proud of being an Indian. It shows that we are capable of achieving great feats, indeed! </p>

								<p>I just fall in love everyday in the metro.</p>

								<h2><b>Musings of a Metro traveller</b></h2>
								<center><h3>Dhwani Mohan, MSIT</h3><center><br><Br>
								<p>There he was, leaning against the wall. He had offered his seat to a lady (not sure if she could be referred to as one, considering the condescendingly intimidating expressions on her face and the horrifying aura that she was carrying around her), like a true gentleman would. A pair of headphones, resting on his messy hair, kissing the outlines of his ears. A pair of Ray-Ban shades, shining victoriously, sitting at the top his pear shaped nose, a hint of blue eyes peeking in through those translucent brown lenses. And from what I could decipher, his perfectly shaped lips were mumbling something familiar, something I had had an encounter with, something I knew.. I looked at those again. They were moving perfectly, not that there was a code of conduct conventionally set, that had to be followed. I followed the movements of his mouth, trying my best to focus on deciphering whatever it was that they were trying to say to..me, but in vain. My eyes traced the curve of his neck, going all the way down to his broad shoulders. His loose T-shirt was not really accentuating his physique but one could get a glimpse of it from the protruding muscles from his arms, that subtly showed through the sleeves. My eyes followed back to tracing the features of his very beautiful face, his indented cheeks, his square jaw, and those eys, oh, those eyes! “Take those shades off”, I murmured under my breath. And it was almost as if God had blessed me with a midas tongue that he gradually slipped out his hand out of the pocket of the rotten pair of jeans that he was wearing and his thoughts concurred with mine. He unveiled his eyes with his hands and I couldn’t help but gaze at those with an expression on my face that I did not particularly want to show. I caught myself smiling like an idiot, for ‘apparently’ no reason at all. Those eyes, oh, those blue eyes! They moved around to scan the compartment, as if, to look for someone desperately. My heart was pounding. I fixed my hair and reset my position, like a kid would on seeing his teacher who’s supposed to grade him for the day. I felt..stupid, but delusionally happy. This was it. His eyes were following and would soon set their gaze on my face. I breathed, deep in, preparing myself for the moment. And boom! Our eyes met. His thick lashes disrupting the lock that his eyes had with mine, as he blinked. I was unconsciously trying not to do the same. I wanted to have the most of this moment, I didn’t want to miss a single blink of his eye, a single wrinkle on his forehead, a single freckle on his face. He might not be the most beautiful face I had ever seen, but he was sort of..perfect. My eyes locked on his, and it wasn’t until a second or two that I realized that there was a curve forming on his face and I could feeling my heart pounding right out of my chest. It was like a celebration inside my stomach, a party..like a thousand butterflies dancing inside and a single glimpse of this carnival showed on my face with a reciprocating curve. I wanted this. So badly. I wanted to go up to him and tell him how I had fallen for his eyes, his smile and his hair, but fate had planned otherwise. The bliss of two seconds was crushed by a voice saying, “Next station is Rajiv Chowk”. He turned his face in a thousand directions, gathering himself. I wasn’t sure until I saw him picking up his bag from the floor. I was..befuddled. I did not know what to say or do. I could’ve run a thousand miles to stay in this very moment, but reality kicked in. There was a knot in my stomach. I felt a sting. I desperately wanted him to stay. The pain was ascending now. I looked at him turn his back to me, waiting for the doors to open. I waited for one last glance and again, God was probably listening to all of my desires, but fulfilling only some, like a sadistic benefactor. He turned his head back to me and I saw the familiar curve on his face. It hit me like a thousand trucks. The pain was excruciating. I was resisting the pain with all my heart and gut and I succeeded. I think..because it wasn’t the pain that I was feeling now..I felt nothing..as I watched the doors open and witnessed his exit..from my life. I’d never see him..I went numb. </p>
								
								<p>I was looking around like a zombie, seeing things, not thinking. And it wasn’t until the closing of the doors was disrupted by a figure that I grew out of my suicidal thoughts. I looked at the figure fighting his way through the doors and victoriously finding his way in. He was panting. I could see his face cringing..but it was sort of..beautiful. He kept his bag on the floor and started to gather himself. I felt the blood rushing through my veins again as I watched him settle in. There he was now, leaning against the walls..</p>

								<h2><b>10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT ME</b></h2>
								<center><h3>Rahul Krishnan</h3><center><br><Br>
								<p>Given a chance and anonymity, of course, which obviously makes it much easier, we can list a thousand things that we hate about every other person we know. And if you are a student, you must be very eager and anxious to let someone know what you hate about them (considering the age and general daily life of a student).Letting a person know that you hate something about them seems easy, But are we ready to accept our own short comings? Can we digest the scenario of a person coming up to us and saying that they hate some particular thing about us? Perhaps not!</p>

								<p>Our egos don’t allow us to take that from another person. So what if….the other person is ME? Seems fair then. Certainly no ego issues in this case.I’ll attempt to think of, and list, 10 things that I hate about myself. You are free to read ‘I’ as ‘we’ if you think you hate that particular thing about yourself too. Knowing that you are not the only one might ease the acceptance process.</p>

								<ol>
								<br><br><li> <b>I think I am funny</b></li><br><br>

								<p>Why do I hate that? Read it again….i ‘think’ I am funny. Don’t you just hate it when you crack a fantastic bone tickler but everyone around has one of these three reactions</p>

								<ul>
								<br><li>”You sure help me with files and stuff so I’ll laugh” look.(100% chance that the fake laughter burns your insides)</li>
								<br><li>”oh god…you poor thing” stare.(you start questioning your existence in the universe at this point)</li>
								<br><li>Someone saying”ayeeee hayeeeee” or “p.j” just after you finish (and you stand there confused as hell…..because people laugh to that, and not your joke).</li>
								</ul>
								<br><p>So sometimes I keep on bombarding the masses with my evergreen classics, without knowing what kind of pain they have to endure. To all you poor ‘funny’ people, let’s stand united and have it scribbled in our brave hearts that not all arrows from a quiver reach the bull’s eye. Yet, the quiver is not to be blamed.</p>
								
								<br><br><li><b>I care a lot</b></li><br><br>

								<p>Before you go ‘awwwwwww’. Let me tell you one thing you must never forget (Read that in one of these four voices: Gandalf the white, Dumbaldore, the Dark Vader, or Morgan Freeman). Caring a lot about everything that is around you might get you a “you are so nice J “text from the girl you like every leap year. But that is never going to get you a minute of peace. I am not advocating that being a selfish and mean person is right.NO! ONE MUST NOT BE SELFISH!</p>

								<p>But take a moment and think….What do you do if you care about anything, You ‘worry’…so basically, caring has you worried all the time and while you think that you would be appreciated for being a caring modern day saint,you are wrong ,rather you are thought of as a buzz kill or fun killer. So if you have a good heart, reserve it for worthy people. Chances are, they might fail to appreciate it. But a good heart is always filled with hope…don’t lose it. And all you other heartless monsters. You can stop laughing at this one now! (if you wish to J ßsee that…that’s me being caring and nice)</p>

								<br><br><li><b>I am a big foodie</b></li><br><br>

								<p>If you have your hands raised for a high five and at the same time, are wondering if that is something to hate, let me tell you this, first of all, hi5. Secondly, it is a thing to hate if you hang around with people who just eat to survive. Mostly because otherwise you’d have to hate all your good friends so it’s just easy to hate your own appetite.Every once in while I have to suffer torments like being called a bhukkad, or someone casually squeezing a “kitna khaega” in the lunch time conversations. It’s funny that people don’t actually hate it if you are foodie; they just act in a way that makes you hate it yourself.</p>

								<p>So if you eat 2 quantities more of anything than others, it’s just better to eat it alone or with a food buddy. A food buddy would never let you feel bad about your kumbhkaran appetite and would gladly give you a competition. If you have a food buddy already, I bet you are thinking about him/her right now….say a silent thanks to them! If you are not a foodie….it’s just bad that you don’t treat foodies right….’shame shame puppy shame’!!!!</p>

								<br><br><li><b>I am always up for a competition</b></li><br><br>

								<p>I am one of those people who have this extreme case of obsessive compulsive thing with winning every argument, every trivia and every other stupid thing that has you competing in any way with anything. I might just punch my own shadow to establish that I am tougher (remember point 1? Yeah this is it!)</p>

								<p>From video games to chidia udd,I get extremely cranky if I lose at something. It doesn’t even have to be at something I am good at.Do you think you have the same problem??….well my problem is more severe…so I win! You lose!</p>

								<p>na nana na na nana nana naa naaa!!!</p>

								<br><br><li><b>I am very honest</b></li><br><br>

								<p>You might have figured out how this is something I hate. So I’ll not explain.</p>

								<p>When I was young, my teacher would appreciate my honesty and….wait!....i am just making that up. Truth is, my honesty was never rewarded. I laugh at all those moral science books I was made to read which had ‘honesty is the best policy’ written on it which, now I think were pamphlets of propaganda to make children stupid or something.</p>

								<p>I mean, think of this scenario…..Johny Johny….yes papa….eating sugar? Yes papa (Johny gets beaten crazy because Johny wasn’t supposed to eat sugar (Indian household)), Atleast Johny was able to stall the beating for a couple of more rhymes by lying. Don’t be a liar. Just if you can learn some white lies….it would be great. I often have friends ask me what I hate about them or something like that…while they expect a cheesy “nothing at all”, My honest, yet stupid brain thinks of a thousand things and my mouth which is eternally enslaved to my brain, does its duty and blabber all that I can think of,in one breath! This obviously leaves the other person enraged and with a sudden thirst for my blood.</p>

								<p>And for dummies who could not figure out why I hate being honest…honesty always lands you in trouble…confession is always the last thing one must do(unless it’s anything related to love or something in that case..bol daal! ). By the way Write all this down if you want to live through kalyug!</p>

								<li><b>I don’t take risks</b></li><br><br>

								<p>Okay serious stuff here. i hate this because, taking a risk puts you on edge, If you don’t, you blend in with the background….but you never stand out!</p>

								<p>I believe a winner is who does something unique. And to do something unique… you need to take a risk. Playing it safe always has you in a no lose no profit situation. That is fine until your ambitions take over your ways of life.</p>

								<p>Imagine the thrill of gambling with everything and anything you do.(no I don’t mean the way Pandavas did….if you are actually thinking of cards, casinos and Las Vegas….you need a to read a book or two about poetic writing skills!). What I mean is, being ready to go the extra mile to stand out than the rest of the crowd! If you believe you have this tendency of playing life safely….you might want to rethink your approach towards everything or else you might feel stuck or caged forever.</p>

								<br><br><li><b>I am very self-obsessed</b></li><br><br>

								<p>Okay now this is something that every teenager can connect with. I love myself to an extent that I believe cupid’s golden arrow stuck my sorry bum when I was in front of a mirror. I don’t ACTUALLY hate this about me, but I sure want to minimize the extent to which I am self-obsessed.</p>

								<p>That is mainly because, i have often observed that people around me get really irritated (I like to believe that they are jealous…but that’s a secret! Shhhhh!!!) when they see my love for myself. Be it the selfies I take or the humongous hours I spend ogling myself at the mirror, one would be very right to give me a narcissist tag. Now if you don’t know the difference between being self-obsessed and being a narcissist, then read on. Do you have your own picture as your phone’s background? Does your phone gallery contain more selfies than any other photo? If yes? Then my friend, thou art a narcissist!</p>

								<p>Now the problem is, in the whole process of loving yourself, you sometimes forget to appreciate the loving actions that others might direct towards you. So if you can change that about you, that would be nice. And as of me, I don’t plan to change that about me any time soon. Perhaps I love the love that I lovingly give myself.</p>

								<br><br><li><b>I get bored very easily</b></li><br><br>

								<p>This! I just hate this about me, and yet I can’t devise any way to improve this about me.</p>

								<p>The main reason for this problem is my hyper fluctuating attention span. Get this, I get ‘bored’ with something because I develop an ‘interest’ in something very quickly! It’s funny if you think that. This trait of mine has proven to be extremely annoying to the people around me. Many of them have thought of me being uninterested is because there words/actions are boring. Well, to my very interesting friends, I act like that, not because I don’t find you interesting or anything, it’s just that I find some other thing(s) more interesting that your words/actions….and perhaps you!</p>

								<p>If you experience the same, you might also know the pain of having to endure a whole song with your friends, while in your head you’ve already played the whole playlist. You might have to sit through a whole movie while your brain starts recollecting all the movies you ever saw.</p>

								<p>It’s just sad when you outgrow the current trends. And then you are stuck until a new one is created. You can beat that by doing something unique. This is something I do personally. And by unique, I don’t mean doing something extremely crazy or anything. You just have to think of unique ways to occupy yourself, because the usual listening to music/sketching/cooking just won’t do any good!</p>

								<br><br><li><b>I sleep a lot</b></li><br><br>

								<p>This is something I love and hate at the same time. And surely this is something we all have in common! It is just so tempting. We all love to shut out our little windows to the world and catch a little peace in the form of sleep and transcend into a world of dreams. The whole thing seems so magical, you just can’t get enough of it. Be it a big 14 hour sleep on my lovely bed or the open eyed nap during a lecture, I love to sleep. I’d rather prefer a good sleep (everyday) than most of the leisures available to a mortal being.</p>

								<p>Now you might think why I hate it when I am clearly so in love with the whole concept of sleep. I do love the concept of sleep, the ‘concept’. But sleeping itself renders zero productivity! Think about all the time you waste sleeping which undoubtedly you can invest in something that might actually do you any good, yes I know the effects of sleep on health! But practically, too much sleeping is unhealthy altogether!</p>

								<p>Hours flushed down the drain. Hours which can actually be utilized in fulfilling of dreams than piling them up in your sleep!</p>

								<p>So I believe if I could just keep my nap hours to the minimum, I can actually have many hours of productive time which I can waste by doing something else than sleeping! Or perhaps use that in doing something productive.</p>

								<br><br><li><b>I have a short fuse</b></li><br><br>

								<p>Raise your hand if you have a temper issue. If you rose a clinched fist, you have a temper issue, otherwise I don’t think you problem is severe enough.</p>

								<p>My fuse, in my own opinion, is very close to 1.2365 millimeter. It doesn’t take the tiniest of a trigger to make me all green and big like the hulk! But that doesn’t mean I start smashing things and start swinging people into air. I just get really mad and perhaps start shouting. But the real damage occurs when I start thinking. Ever felt the need to twist the sweet life out of a person? But still stand there without even a tiny eye lid movement? If yes, then you sure understand the heart burn. It all happens inside your head, you can’t act out but you just want to become a human tornado.</p>

								<p>And the funniest thing is, ‘you’ don’t even have to take an offense. Sometimes you can’t see how someone else has a bad situation and get mad at that! Sometimes the things that set you off might not even extract a frown if it were someone else in your place or others would not even care to notice. Some reasons would actually qualify for absurd and crazy for normal people. For example: I actually get mad at random birds when they decide to show there mugs through my window (hi5 if you hate pigeons and there mannerisms) Or sometimes I just wish my keyboard was a guy so I can punch the juice out of him whenever a key is jammed. If you have the same problem, try back counting loudly or drinking a lot of water. Back counting loudly when you are angry would make people around you laugh and that might lighten the mood. And drinking a lot of water might put you at risk of spilling it on your clothes while shouting with a mouthful of water.(try it the next time!)</p>

								<p>So these are 10 things that I think I hate about me, and these are 10 things that make me unique. That’s right, whatever you hate about yourself is also what makes you different. We tend to love our similarities with others and often forget to cherish our differences. When I really think about it, I wouldn’t want to change all that I hate about myself. Perhaps I should try and change them in a way that they don’t affect the people around me. So if come across anything that you hate about yourself, know this, it is a unique trait that you have, and you should be proud of it, just take care that it doesn’t make someone else sad or anything, rest you don’t have to change a single freckle about yourself!!</p>
